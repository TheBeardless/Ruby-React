Some Best Practice
- creating a private method to define what params can be permitted in an API to mitigate some unethical hacking. 
- active record validation helpers. example:"rating": ["17 isn't within 1 and 10"]
- exception handling
- namespace and versioning ie /api/v1/snacks
  
What I couldn't do: 
- "Webpacker now supports react.js ðŸŽ‰" and you can create a frontend and backend in 1 directory to be hosted on one server (ie. Heroku). - didn't do this as it's a bit of a stretch goal. 
- render json: {message: something}, new record, status: :ok
